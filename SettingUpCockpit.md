# Managing ZFS with Cockpit and ZFS Manager on DietPi

Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers, simplifying server management with its intuitive dashboard. By integrating the ZFS Manager plugin, you can manage ZFS pools and datasets directly from your browser. Here's how to set up Cockpit on DietPi, install ZFS, and add the ZFS Manager plugin.

### Install Cockpit on DietPi

Cockpit is available in Debian since version 10 (Buster). To access the latest version of Cockpit on DietPi, enabling the backports repository is recommended.

1. **Enable the Backports Repository**:

   As root or using `sudo`, enable the Debian backports repository to access the latest Cockpit package:
   ```bash
   . /etc/os-release
   echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian ${VERSION_CODENAME}-backports main" > \
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list
   apt update
   ```

2. **Install or Update Cockpit**:

   Install Cockpit from the backports repository:
   ```bash
   apt install -t ${VERSION_CODENAME}-backports cockpit
   ```

3. **Restart the VM**:

   After installing or updating Cockpit, it's necessary to restart your VM to ensure that Cockpit works correctly and to avoid any HTTPS certificate errors when trying to access it. Use the following command to restart your VM:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Access Cockpit**: Once your VM is back online, you can access the Cockpit web interface by navigating to `https://<your-dietpi-ip>:9090` in your web browser. Log in with your DietPi credentials.

### Install ZFS

Proceed with the installation of ZFS on your DietPi system by updating your system, installing ZFS utilities, kernel headers, and loading the ZFS kernel module as described in the previous sections.

### Install ZFS Manager for Cockpit

1. **Download and Install the ZFS Manager Plugin**: The ZFS Manager plugin enhances the Cockpit experience by enabling direct management of ZFS pools and datasets from the web interface. This plugin is available at:

   [https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-zfs-manager](https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-zfs-manager)

   Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository to integrate the ZFS Manager into Cockpit.

2. **Restart Cockpit**: Ensure the new plugin is recognized and loaded by restarting the Cockpit service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart cockpit
   ```

### Manage ZFS Pools and Datasets

With the ZFS Manager plugin now part of your Cockpit setup, a new ZFS menu item will be available in the Cockpit sidebar. This interface simplifies the process of managing your ZFS configurations, allowing for easier creation, management, and monitoring of ZFS pools and datasets.

### Conclusion

The combination of Cockpit and the ZFS Manager plugin on DietPi or any Debian-based system offers a powerful and user-friendly approach to managing complex ZFS storage configurations. Remember to adhere to best practices for data management, including regular system and data backups, to maintain data integrity and system reliability.
